Read paper:
I. Hong, M. Potkonjak, and M. B. Srivastava, “On-line scheduling of hard real-time tasks on variable voltage processor,” Proc. Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), pages 653–656, November 1998.

# Schedule sporadic tasks
- Accept tasks as they arrive dynamically; not predetermined at start
- Schedule tasks to respect deadlines
- Reject tasks that are unschedulable given prior scheduled tasks

# Adjust execution speed to save energy
- Slow down tasks with extra time (according to paper's guidelines)

# Respect context switching times
- Whenever changing from one task to another
- When preempt or when complete, both need context switch
- Paper does not address this issue!
- "Computation time" is longer than listed by at least 1x CST and more if multiple context switches (preempts) occur

# Read input file, write output file
